# UAE HR Portal - Employee Guide

## Welcome! 👋

This is your UAE HR Portal. Here's what you can do and how to use it.

## What Can I Do Here?

### 📝 Submit Requests

You can submit requests for various HR needs:
- Leave applications
- Document requests (certificates, letters)
- Visa/Emirates ID assistance
- Medical insurance queries
- General HR questions

**How?**
1. Use the request submission form (coming soon)
2. You'll receive a unique reference number (like REF-2026-001)
3. Keep this number to track your request

### 🔍 Track My Requests

You can check the status of your requests anytime without logging in!

**How?**
1. Go to "Track My Request" in the menu
2. Enter your reference number (REF-YYYY-NNN)
3. See your request status and timeline

**Status Meanings:**
- **Submitted** - We've received your request and it's in the queue
- **Reviewing** - HR is looking at your request now
- **Approved** - Good news! Your request is approved
- **Completed** - All done! No further action needed
- **Not Approved** - Please contact HR to discuss

### 💬 Understanding Your Timeline

When you track a request, you'll see:
- When you submitted it
- When status changed
- Public notes from HR (feedback for you)
- What happens next

**Note:** Internal HR notes are not visible to you - those are for HR team coordination only.

## Important Tips

### ✅ Do's
- Keep your reference number safe
- Check your request status regularly
- Read public notes from HR carefully
- Provide complete information in your requests

### ❌ Don'ts
- Don't share your reference number publicly
- Don't submit duplicate requests (just track the original)
- Don't worry if status is "Reviewing" for a few days - HR is working on it!

## Need Help?

### Can't Find Your Reference Number?
Unfortunately, we can't look it up without it. Please keep your reference numbers in a safe place (email, notes app, etc.).

### Status Hasn't Changed?

- If it's been more than 5 business days, contact HR directly
