# UAE HR Portal - HR Staff Guide

## Welcome to the HR Command Center 🎯

This guide explains how to use the HR portal to manage employee requests and stay compliant with UAE regulations.

## Your Main Tools

### 1. HR Request Queue (`/hr`)

This is your main workspace for processing employee requests.

**What You See:**
- All requests in the system
- Full details including internal notes
- Filter by status (submitted, reviewing, approved, completed)
- Statistics dashboard

**How to Process Requests:**

1. **Open the HR Queue**
   - Click "HR Queue" in the navigation
   - You'll see all requests, newest first

2. **Filter by Status**
   - Use the filter buttons to see:
     - All requests
     - Submitted (needs your attention)
     - Reviewing (you're working on it)
     - Approved (waiting for completion)
     - Completed (done)

3. **Update a Request**
   - Click "Update Request" on any request card
   - Change the status
   - Add public notes (employee will see these)
   - Add internal notes (HR-only, for team coordination)
   - Click "Update Request"

**Best Practices:**
- Review submitted requests within 1-2 business days
- Always add public notes when changing status (employee sees these)
- Use internal notes to coordinate with team members
- Mark as "Completed" only when everything is done

### 2. UAE Compliance Calendar (`/compliance`)

Track important UAE-specific deadlines and requirements.

**What You'll See:**
- Upcoming compliance events (next 30-60 days)
- Red alerts for critical items (7 days or less)
- Orange warnings (needs attention)
- Blue for normal tracking

**Event Types:**

**WPS Deadline (10th of each month)**
- Wage Protection System payment deadline
- CRITICAL: Must pay salaries by 10th for previous month
- Missing this has serious legal consequences

**Visa Expiry**
- Employee visa expiration dates
- Alerts at 60, 30, and 7 days before
- Start renewal process at 60 days

**Emirates ID Expiry**
- National ID card expiration
- Renewal required 30 days before expiry
- Employee needs this for many transactions

**Medical Insurance Expiry**
- Health insurance expiration
- Must maintain continuous coverage
- Renew 30 days before expiry

**Ramadan Working Hours**
- Reminder to adjust working hours during Ramadan
- Reduced hours required by law
- Plan ahead for staffing

### 3. Public Request Tracking (`/track`)

This is what employees see when they track their requests.

**Important:**
- Internal notes are NEVER shown here
- Only public notes are visible
- This helps you understand employee experience

**Test It:**
- Enter a reference number (like REF-2026-001)
- See what the employee sees
- Make sure your public notes are helpful and clear

## Request Status Workflow

### Typical Flow:

1. **Submitted** → Employee creates request
   - They get a reference number
   - Appears in your queue
   - Status: "Pending Review"

2. **Reviewing** → You're working on it
   - Update status to "Reviewing"
   - Add public note: "We're reviewing your request. We'll update you soon."
   - Use internal notes for team coordination

3. **Approved** → Decision made
   - If approved: Change to "Approved"
   - Add public note explaining next steps
   - Complete the actual work

4. **Completed** → All done
   - Change to "Completed"
   - Add public note confirming completion
   - Archive handled

5. **Rejected** → Not approved
   - Change to "Rejected"
   - IMPORTANT: Add clear public note explaining why
   - Be professional and helpful

## Communication Guidelines

### Public Notes (Employee Sees These)

✅ **Good Examples:**
- "Your request is approved. We'll process your certificate and email it to you by [date]."
- "We need more information. Please contact HR with your employee ID."
- "Your leave request is approved for [dates]. Enjoy your time off!"

❌ **Bad Examples:**
- "Approved" (too brief, no context)
- "Check with finance first" (internal process, confusing)
- "Maybe, not sure" (unprofessional)

### Internal Notes (HR Team Only)

Use these for:
- Coordination: "Waiting for finance approval"
- References: "Related to request REF-2026-045"
- Reminders: "Follow up on Tuesday"
- Context: "Employee is on probation"

## UAE Compliance Reminders

### Monthly Tasks
- **10th of month**: WPS deadline (CRITICAL)
- Check upcoming visa expirations
- Review medical insurance renewals

### Quarterly Tasks
- Audit Emirates ID expiration dates
- Plan for Ramadan adjustments (check Islamic calendar)
- Review compliance calendar for next 90 days

### Annual Tasks
- Visa renewals (as they come due)
- Medical insurance renewal season
- Labor card renewals

## Troubleshooting

### Request Stuck in "Reviewing"?
- Have you updated the employee with public notes?
- Is there a blocker? Document in internal notes
- If taking longer than expected, let employee know

### Can't Find a Request?
- Use the reference number (REF-YYYY-NNN)
- Check filters - might be in a different status
- Check if it's in completed requests

### Compliance Alert Showing Red?
- URGENT: Less than 7 days to deadline
- Take immediate action
- Don't ignore red alerts

## Need Technical Support?

Contact IT/System Admin:
- Email: it@company.ae
- For login issues, access problems, or bugs

## Security Reminders

- Never share employee request details outside HR
- Internal notes are confidential
- Reference numbers should not be public
- Log out when leaving your desk
